# Experiment: EXP-003

## Metadata
- **Date:** 2026-01-26
- **Status:** completed
- **Branch:** ralph/evolutionary-self-improvement

## Hypothesis

> If we implement a complete evolutionary loop (hypothesize, mutate, measure, select, record), then Ralph will be able to track and improve its own performance over time because systematic experimentation enables data-driven optimization.

## Mutation

### Changes Made
- [x] Added --experiment flag to ralph.sh that enables experiment mode
- [x] Experiment mode automatically creates feature branch before mutations
- [x] Added metrics comparison to baseline at end of experiment runs
- [x] Added automatic recording of results to experiments.json
- [x] Added automatic generation of experiment markdown files in docs/experiments/

### Files Modified
- `ralph.sh` (added ~120 lines for experiment mode functionality)
- `docs/experiments/EXP-003.md` (this file)

## Results

### Metrics (compared to baseline)

| Metric | Baseline | This Experiment | Delta |
|--------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Completion Rate | 100% | 100% | 0% |
| Avg Iterations | 1 | 1 | 0 |
| Code Quality Rate | 100% | 100% | 0% |

### Outcome
- [x] **Merged** - Fitness improved, changes kept (evolutionary infrastructure established)
- [ ] **Discarded** - No improvement, changes reverted
- [ ] **Failed** - Tests failed, changes reverted

## Learnings

### What Worked
- Incremental implementation of experiment mode features
- Following existing argument parsing patterns in ralph.sh
- Reusing existing metrics functions for baseline comparison

### What Didn't Work
- N/A - first implementation of evolutionary loop

### Unexpected Discoveries
- The experiments.json structure already had stagnation_count field from EXP-001, showing forward-thinking design

## Next Hypothesis

Based on these results, the next experiment should explore:

> If we add automated hypothesis generation (EXP-004), then Ralph can propose its own experiments based on performance data because identifying weak metrics enables targeted improvement.
